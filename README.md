# ![CS210](http://i.imgur.com/WdBU7U5.png) Startup your team
You've been paired up with a corporate partner. Congratulations! Now it's time to start up your team and settle on a project to do.

### Team Name 
Mirage 

### Design a logo!

### Choose team theme music!
Stranger Things Theme Song 

### Create your team's home page
The TTeam will create a repository for your team. **This repo is for your team's documentation: This Github Readme.md file has to be the jumping off point to your documentation.**  You can use the filesystem, Wiki and built-in Web elements Github provides by default for your project or you are free to link to external resources. Whatever you prefer, as long as the Github Readme.md file is the jumping off point. Please note you can also store your source code in this repo, but it is recommended that you ask the TTeam to create you a second repository for code to have documentation and code in separate repositories.

Create a new team home page (using README.md) in your team's home repo that includes at least the following:
- **Your team name**
- **Team logo**
- **Team theme music**
- **Team member photos, names**
- **A synopsis of your project (Christian)**


- **Links for team communication:** how we should get in touch with you, how you keep in touch with each other - Slack, email, HipChat, etc.
- Messenger for inter-team communication.
- Asana for project management. 
- Mailing List to contact team members. 
- Slack for team communication. 
- Google Drive for storing relevant files. 

    
### [Connect with your liaisons](https://github.com/cs210/Home/blob/master/Assignments/02-Startup%20Your%20Team/connect-with-liasons.md)
Get in touch with your corporate partner! This includes setting up a Feb 8th meeting. [Take a look at some guidelines for driving these meetings.](https://github.com/cs210/Home/blob/master/Assignments/02-Startup%20Your%20Team/manage-liason-meetings.md)

### Sign up for an SGM slot

### Create a team skills matrix
Make a table showing areas of expertise relevant to your project and showing gaps that will likely need filling. 

You can do this [directly in your README.md](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables), embed a picture, or link a document.

An example is below. You may want to use the 6 Hats Survey results and other data then what is shown in this example.

### Start benchmarking and need finding per todayâ€™s lecture

Come up with ideas. Interview your potential users. Your future is **up to you**.

### Have fun!
